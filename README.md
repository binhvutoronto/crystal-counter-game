# Crystal Counter Game

This is the crystal game counter.

You will be given a random number at the start of the game.

There are four crystals below. By clicking on a crystal you will add a specific amount of points to your total score.

You win the game by matching your total score to the random number chosen by the game. You lose the game if your total score goes above this random number.

The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it.

Each time the game starts, it will change the values of each crystal.
